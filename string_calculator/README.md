# String Calculator - TDD Assignment

This project is a **String Calculator** implemented in Dart using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. The goal is to ensure clean, readable, and testable code while following best practices in software craftsmanship.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Handles an empty string as input.
- Supports single and multiple numbers separated by `,` or `\n`.
- Allows custom delimiters of any length (e.g., `//[***]\n1***2***3` returns `6`).
- Ignores numbers greater than `1000` (e.g., `2 + 1001 = 2`).
- Throws an exception when negative numbers are passed.
